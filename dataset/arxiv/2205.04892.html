<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a rich repository to track a patient’s health status.
EHRs seek to fully document the patient’s physiological status,
and include data that is is high dimensional, heterogeneous, and multimodal.
The significant differences in the sampling frequency of clinical variables
can result in high missing rates and uneven time intervals between adjacent records in the multivariate clinical time-series data extracted from EHRs.
Current studies using clinical time-series data for patient characterization view the patient’s physiological status
as a discrete process described by sporadically collected values,
while the dynamics in patient’s physiological status are time-continuous.
In addition, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) models widely used for patient representation learning lack the
perception of time intervals and velocity, which limits the ability of the model to represent the physiological status of the patient.</p>
<p id="id4.id2" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose an improved gated recurrent unit (GRU), namely time- and velocity-aware GRU (GRU-TV),
for patient representation learning of clinical multivariate time-series data in a time-continuous manner.
In proposed GRU-TV, the neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and velocity perception mechanism are used to perceive
the time interval between records in the time-series data and changing rate of the patient’s physiological status, respectively.
Experimental results on two real-world clinical EHR datasets(PhysioNet2012, MIMIC-III) show that GRU-TV achieve state-of-the-art performance
in computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tasks, and is more advantageous in processing sampled data.</p>

<div id="Sx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">With continual advancements of informatization and digitization,
many fields have recorded and accumulated multitude of time-series data,
including health care <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, climate analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and quantitative investment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>.
According to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) of the National Inpatient Sample (NIS),
in 2018, more than 7 million patients in the United States were hospitalized, and over 10 million medical records are generated
<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/nation/nis/nissummstats.jsp</span></span></span>.
Clinically, clinician decisions on treatment and diagnosis of diseases rely heavily on the individual patient’s medical records,
such as lab tests, previous procedures, medications, and diagnoses.
Therefore, these rich medical records provide an opportunity for computer assist diagnosis (CAD) applications, specifically with machine learning methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, there has been research focused on clinical needs using patient representation learning,
such as patient subtyping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>,
mortality prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>,
length-of-stay prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>,
24-hour decompensation  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>,
and multi-task learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can share weights between layers, which allows them to be suitable for modeling sequence data of variable length.
Therefore, RNN and its variant models like long-short term memory (LSTM),
and gate recurrent unit (GRU) are widely used for patient representation learning with time-series data among these previous studies.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Health care data extracted fom electronic health records (EHRs) are usually high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and multimodal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>,
since the data points in EHRs are typically collected from different resources, such as medical sensors and examination procedures.
The observation frequency varies widely across variables in these health care data, and some values are randomly or intentionally omitted,
which results in the irregular sampling intervals and data sparsity in medical time-series data.
However, a basic assumptions of RNNs is that
the elapsed time between the adjacent records of time-series data are consistent,
which makes RNNs inherently flawed in patient representation learning using clinical multivariate time-series data generated after time alignment of data points in EHRs.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Improved RNN models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> adapt to clinical time-series data by augmenting the input with a time interval.
These methods require nonlinear mapping of time intervals as extended input to the RNN unit, and treat the patient’s physiological status as a discrete process.
The RNNs with decay term proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> decay the hidden state in forward propagation by the time decay term,
which was proven not to improve performance over standard RNN in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.
How to update the hidden state of an RNN in a time-continuous manner?
Some methods have tried to apply ordinary differential equation (ODE) to RNN for processing non-uniformly sampled time-series data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>
after the neural ODE was proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
These methods are more flexible but require solving for the ODE of hidden state and lack intuition.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In addition,
instantaneous vital sign rates are related to physiological dynamics and are important indicators of the human health condition <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>.
thus, perception of changes in a patient’s physical condition is also critical for patient representation learning.
However, current RNN models, whether representing a patient’s physiological status in a continuous or discrete manner,
lack the ability to perceive the changes of patient’s physiological status.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we propose a Time- and Velocity-aware GRU (GRU-TV) for patient representation based on GRU.
In the proposed GRU-TV, the update of the hidden state and the forward propagation of the RNN in the time dimension are two parallel veins
that interact through the ODE of the hidden state and the time interval between adjacent records.
Inspired by neural ODE, the forward propagation of hidden states between timestamps is
improved so as to perform patient representation learning in a time-continuous manner with unevenly sampled clinical multivariate
time-series data and with the ability to perceive variable time intervals between adjacent records in the sequence.
Besides, the velocity prediction is applied by expanding the instantaneous rate of hidden state as the input compared with standard GRU.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We hypothesize that our approach is not limited to GRU but can be applied to all existing RNN and its variants as a plug-and-play plugins,
which allows feeding sporadic records into a time-continuous dynamics representation of patient’s physiological status evolution.
This model is task-independent and can be applied to the learning patient representation of various tasks,
including, phenotyping, in-hospital mortality prediction, length-of-stay prediction, etc.
We conduct extensive experiments on Physionet2012 and MIMIC-III datasets, GRU-TV outperforms existing benchmarks,
Comparisons with baseline models and ablation experimental results demonstrate that both the time-interval and velocity-aware mechanisms in our proposed GRU-TV have gains for patient representation learning.
The intuitiveness and effectiveness shall benefit further technology and clinical research.</p>

<div id="Sx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Related works using deep learning models for patient representation learning, such as length of stay prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, in-hospital mortality prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>,

of modeling clinical time-series data with a deep learning model following a task-specific output layer.
Therefore, the design of deep learning model used for patient representation based on EHR is critical for the the performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Modeling of EHR data</span>
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>, a clinical decision support system using only the heart rate signal was developed.
More studies, however, often use multimodal data to perform diverse clinical-assisted decision-making tasks
and improve the prediction accuracy.
Other work has proposed unstructured text records and waveform data for Patient representation
in addition to the sporadically recorded structured data in the EHR.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, electrocardiogram (EGG) data is integrated with discrete clinical events
to predict the decompensation and length of stay.
This high-density data are embedded into low-dimensional representations by convolutional neural networks (CNN),
and the multi-channel attention is used to assign weights to high-density EGG and various clinical variables in a learning style.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, both narrative text and numerical records were used
for the prediction of in-hospital mortality, 30-day unplanned readmission, and prolonged length of stay.
Specifically,
a sequence of time-ordered tokens throughout the patient’s records
from the beginning of recording until the point of prediction is formed by
splitting the medical event data in each attribute into discrete values,
splitting the clinical note text into a sequence of tokens,
and normalizing the numeric values in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
While in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>, a similar approach is used for numerical measurements and lab values,
clinical notes, and static demographics,
after which these numerical multimodal data were formed into a structured patient record.</p>

<p id="Sx2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Perception of uneven time intervals</span>
Uneven time interval between two adjacent records in the time-series sequence is another characteristic of clinical multivariate time-series data,
which results from differences in data modality (e.g., waveform data,text of medical prescriptions, and medical examination result values),
and observation frequency.
The changing rate of variables in real-world data, especially in clinical scenarios,
is also an important consideration for making correct decisions.
However, basic RNNs do not have the ability to perceive the time interval between two adjacent records,
i.e. the time interval between records in the sequence and the changing rates of the variables are assumed to be consistent by default.
Based on the assumption that the longer the time interval, the lower the reliability of the memory inherited by the RNN from the previous moment,
T-LSTM proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> uses the time interval between adjacent records after a nonlinear mapping (monotonically decreasing function)
as a discounting factor for the short-term memory of the previous timestep accepted by the LSTM unit.
In DeepCare <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, the time parameterization is introduced to handle irregular timing by modifying the forget gate.
The study <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> shows another route to improve the forward propagation between adjacent units of the RNN along
the neural ODE proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> so that it possesses the ability to perceive
uneven time intervals between records in a sequence.</p>

<p id="Sx2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="Sx2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Patient representation learning</span>.
In terms of methods, deep learning models are increasingly used in patient representation learning tasks.
These models are generally generic, i.e., task-independent, focusing on the representation of the patient’s physiological
condition from clinical time-series data extracted from the EHR.
Many studies have tried different methods to improve the basic RNN model to adapt to the sparsity,
high dimensionality and inhomogeneity of clinical time series data.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, L Lei, et.al applied a recurrent neural network-based denoising autoencoder to encode patient’s hospital record into a low-dimensional dense vector.
Considering the varying length of patients’ EHRs, the non-negative tensor factorization models the input sequence to a temporal tensor and serves as the input to the LSTM.
In addition to RNNs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are also used for patient representation learning tasks.
Compared with RNN, CNN cannot handle sequence data of indefinite length, so it needs to pre-process the input sequence.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, the patient visit sequence data is used as input to the CNN after being padded to a fixed length,
while in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, CNN is used to extract features from the dense ECG waveform and as part of the input to the RNN model.
In terms of tasks, deep re representation models can be followed by task-specific output layers for various clinical tasks,
such as mortality prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, length-of-stay prediction <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>, patient subtyping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, medical cost <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> etc.

It contains two main components based on GRU, which will be described below:
the time interval perception to perceive the time interval between adjacent records in the sequence,
and the velocity perception to perceive the velocity at which the physiological status representation of the patient corresponding to the input sequence changes.
Our approach is not limited to GRU, but can be applied to any RNN model alive and its variants as a plug-and-play plugin. </p>

and GRU takes fixed-length vectors as input, so data padding is widespread in this data.
The missing variables in the series are filled with the latest value,
that is, the actual value of the filled variable in the previous collection is used as the filling value
(if the record is missing at the beginning of the series, the default value of the variable is used as the real value).
However, a large number of filling values introduce noise into the input data and change the inherent distribution of the variable,
so the filling and real values should be distinguished so that the GRU can perceive the difference.</p>

<p id="Sx4.SSx3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">In clinical practice, the transient rate of vital signs associated with physiological kinetics is an important indicator of a patient’s physiological status.
Therefore, in the proposed GRU-TV, the ordinary differential equations (ODE) of the hidden state is also used as an input thus giving
the GRU the ability to perceive the velocity.
How to parameterize the transient rate of patient’s physical condition by GRU?

The reason for this is that the velocity of the input variable cannot be accurately obtained because there are a large number of filled values in input sequence,

<p id="Sx5.SSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To permit a fair comparison between the methods,
consistent hyperparameters, network setting, training pipline, and dataset splits were used for all the deep learning methods.
The training was stopped if the number of training epoch is greater than 30 and there is no performance improvement
on the validation set for 3 consecutive iterations.
The parameters with the best validation performance were selected to evaluate the performance on test dataset.
The final performance was the average of three independent test performances.
Area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and area under the precisionrecall curve (AUPRC) were the comparison metrics for this paper,
since all tasks are classification in this paper.
The macro average AUC were also calculated for the multi-task classification.</p>

<div id="Sx6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a GRU variant unit for modeling clinical multivariate time-series data, called GRU-T.
GRU-T improves the forward propagation between adjacent GRUs through the ODE of hidden state to continuously
represent the changing process of the patient’s physiological status,
and further, enables GRU the ability to perceive the speed and time interval of changes in relevant clinical variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="Sx6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="Sx6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Compared to RNN models such as GRU and LSTM, GRU-T allows the time interval between records of the input sequence to
be of free length, and eliminating the need for imputation.
GRU-T achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple tasks on both real-world datasets,
especially on sampled simulated data.
Importantly, the hidden state ODE in GRU-T can be used as a plug-and-play plugin in other RNN models and achieve performance improvement,
as shown in our experimental results applying it to the GRU-D model.
In our future work, it will be applied to other specific tasks of patient characterization with
clinical time-series data, to embed it in online real-time alert systems to improve computer aided diagnostics,
and to evaluate the generalizability of our model with real-world data.</p>
