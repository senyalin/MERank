<p id="2.1" class="ltx_p">Security issues have gradually emerged with the continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI). Earlier work verified the possibility of converting neural network models into stegomalware, embedding malware into a model with limited impact on the model’s performance. However, existing methods are not applicable in real-world attack scenarios and do not attract enough attention from the security community due to performance degradation and additional workload. Therefore, we propose an improved stegomalware EvilModel. By analyzing the composition of the neural network model, three new methods for embedding malware into the model are proposed: MSB reservation, fast substitution, and half substitution, which can embed malware that accounts for half of the model’s volume without affecting the model’s performance. We built 550 EvilModels using ten mainstream neural network models and 19 malware samples. The experiment shows that EvilModel achieved an embedding rate of 48.52%. A quantitative algorithm is proposed to evaluate the existing embedding methods. We also design a trigger and propose a threat scenario for the targeted attack. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methods were demonstrated by experiments and analyses of the embedding capacity, performance impact, and detection evasion.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI), represented by deep neural network, had several achievements in various fields and has become a key technology for promoting economic development. However, AI has security issues. Research <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> has demonstrated how attackers can use AI to enhance all stages of an attack, thereby making the attacks more intelligent, concealed, and efficient. For example, DeepLocker <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> introduced a neural network model into targeted attacks and found the target covertly using the model. DeepC2 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> uses a neural network in botnet command and control (C2), delivering commands in a block-resistant manner.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the continuous improvement in the AI industry, AI-powered attacks are more prevalent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Security vendor Beyond Trust <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> pointed out that the proliferation of AI weaponization will bring significant challenges to cybersecurity. Gartner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> stated that, by 2022, 30% of cybersecurity issues would be related to AI security. Fortinet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> also believes that the weaponization of AI will become a trend. Therefore, it is necessary to study AI-powered threats to better understand and defend against them.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Recent research has shown that neural network models can be used as malware carriers for attacks. Stegomalware called StegoNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> was proposed to embed malware into neural network models. The parameters in the models were replaced or mapped with malware bytes. Meanwhile, the model’s performance was maintained because of the complexity and fault tolerance of the models.
One potential attack scenario of StegoNet is to launch supply chain pollution through ML markets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. With the rise of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite> and the open machine learning market, attackers can propagate polluted models through the MLaaS provider and ML market.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The strength of hiding malware in the neural network models are:
i) Detection evasion. After hiding in the models, the malware cannot be disassembled, and its characteristics cannot be extracted. Therefore, it can evade detection.
ii) Concealment. Because of the redundant neurons and excellent generalization ability, the modified models can maintain their original performance without causing anomalies.
iii) High capacity. Normally, neural network models are large and can embed large malware.
iv) Independence. This method does not rely on system vulnerabilities. Malware-embedded models can be delivered through model update channels from the supply chain or alternative ways that do not attract the end-users attention.
v) Universality. As neural networks become more popular, this method will become universal in spreading malware in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the advantages summarized above, we believe that this attack can be used to spread malware. However, as a classic design, StegoNet still has some deficiencies in real-world scenarios from the attacker’s perspective, resulting in insufficient attention from the security community. First, StegoNet has a low embedding rate (defined as a malware/model size). In StegoNet, the upper bound of the embedding rate without accuracy degradation is <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1d">∼</annotation></semantics></math>15%, which is insufficient for embedding large malware into medium- or small-sized models. Second, the StegoNet methods have a significant impact on the model’s performance. The accuracy of the models decreased significantly with the malware size increased, particularly for small-sized models. It renders StegoNet unsuitable for small models. Additionally, StegoNet requires extra effort to embed or extract malware, such as extra training and index permutation, making it impractical.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To raise attention to this emerging threat, we conduct further studies and propose new malware embedding methods. We embedded the malware into neural network models with a high embedding rate and low performance impact. We first analyzed the composition of neural network models and studied how to embed the malware and how much malware can be embedded. Based on the analysis, we propose three embedding methods, MSB (most significant byte) reservation, fast substitution, and half substitution, to embed malware. We embedded 19 malware samples in ten mainstream neural network models and analyzed their performance to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. We propose an evaluation algorithm that combines embedding rate, performance impact, and embedding effort to evaluate the existing methods. To demonstrate the potential threat of this attack, we present a possible attack scenario and study the embedding capacity of neural network models.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Stegomalware is an advanced malware that uses steganography to avoid detection. Malware is concealed in benign carriers such as images, documents, and videos. A typical steganography method is image-based LSB (least significant bit) steganography <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. An image contains pixels with values from 0 to 255. When expressed in binary form, LSBs have little effect on the picture’s appearance. Therefore, they can be replaced by secret messages. Thus, the messages are hidden in the images. Due to its low channel capacity, this method is unsuitable for embedding large-sized malware.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">With the increasing popularity of AI, neural networks have been applied in steganography. Volkhonski et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> proposed a GAN-based image steganography method SGAN (steganographic generative adversarial networks). A carrier image is generated from random noise. The generation network optimizes the network parameters through the feedback of the discriminative and steganalysis network so that the generated image looks natural after embedding information.
Zhang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> proposed an adversarial samples-based image steganography method that resists steganalysis. Adversarial samples can interfere with the judgment of the neural network by making some small changes to the original image that are invisible to the human eye. Using this feature, adding small changes to the carrier image can make it masquerade as a natural image and fool the steganalyzer.
These methods are mainly applied to image steganography.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>StegoNet</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">StegoNet <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> proposes to covertly deliver malware to end devices by malware-embedded neural network models from the supply chain, such as the DNN model market, MLaaS platform, etc. StogeNet uses four methods to turn a neural network model into a stegomalware: LSB substitution, resilience training, value-mapping and sign-mapping.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">LSB substitution.</span> Neural network models are redundant and fault-tolerant. By taking advantage of the sufficient redundancy in neural network models, StegoNet embeds malware bytes into the models by replacing the least significant bits of the parameters. For large-sized models, this method can embed large-sized malware without the performance degradation. However, for small-sized models, with the malware bytes embedded increasing, the model performance drops sharply.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Resilience training.</span> As neural network models are fault-tolerant, StegoNet introduces internal errors in the neuron parameters intentionally by replacing the parameters with malware bytes. Then StegoNet “freezes” the neurons and retrains the model. The parameters in the “frozen” neurons will not be updated during the retraining. There should be an extra “index permutation” to restore the embedded malware. Compared with LSB substitution, this method can embed more malware into a model. The experiments show that the upper bound of the embedding rate for resilience training without accuracy degradation is <math id="S2.SS2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S2.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p3.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S2.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p3.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p3.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.SS2.p3.1.m1.1d">∼</annotation></semantics></math>15%. There is still a significant impact on the model performance, although retraining is performed to restore the performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Value-mapping.</span> StegoNet searches the model parameters to find similar bits to the malware segments and maps (or changes) the parameters with the malware. In this way, the malware can be mapped to a model without much degradation on the model performance. However, it also needs an extra permutation map to restore the malware. Also, in this way, the embedding rate is lower than the methods above.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Sign-mapping.</span> StegoNet also maps the sign of the parameters to the malware bits. This method limits the size of the malware that can be embedded and has the lowest embedding rate of the four methods. Also, the extra permutation map will be huge, making this method impractical.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The common weaknesses of the above mentioned methods are i) they have a low embedding rate, ii) they have a significant impact on the model performance, and iii) they need extra efforts in the embedding works, mainly index permutation or permutation map. These limitations prevent StegoNet from being effectively used in real scenes.</p>

DeepLocker uses the environmental attributes of the target (e.g., face, voice, geolocation, and motion) to train a neural network model (we take the faces as an example). The model generates a steady cryptographic key as the output when the target face is the input. The key encrypts malicious payloads. DeepLocker delivers malware-bundled video software to a victim’s environment through the supply chain. When the software is running, the malware captures the facial images and inputs them into the neural network model. When the target uses the software, the model recognizes it and outputs the crypto key; otherwise, the output is meaningless numbers. Subsequently, the malicious payload can be decrypted and executed. Security analysts cannot obtain the correct key from a model when the target that decrypts the payload is unknown. Therefore, they are unaware of the malicious payload’s intent. DeepLocker transforms the traditional way of identifying targets from an “if-then” mode to a black-box mode.</p>

As AI exceeds many traditional methods in various fields, it is possible to utilize AI to carry out network attacks that are more difficult to defend.
In 2018, 26 researchers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> from different organizations warned against the malicious use of AI. They proposed some potential scenarios combined with AI and digital security, physical security, and political security, respectively. At the same time, AI-powered attacks are emerging.</p>

<div id="S2.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For preparing an attack, Seymour et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite> proposed a highly targeted automated spear phishing method with AI. High-value targets are selected by clustering. Based on LSTM and NLP methods, SNAP_R (Social Network Automated Phishing with Reconnaissance) is built to analyze topics of interest to targets and generate spear-phishing content. The contents are pushed to victims by their active time. Hitaj et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> proposed PassGAN to learn the distributions of real passwords from leaked passwords and generate high-quality passwords.

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by DeepLocker, we design a trigger that can resist defenders analyzing attack targets. We use the neural network as a one-way function. Each target is abstracted into a feature vector, which is the middle layer output of the neural network. Once the feature vector is found, the embedded malware will be extracted. Since the neural network is irreversible and its input is non-enumerable, it is hard for defenders to infer the target with only the neural network model and the feature vector. We think this design is more practical in real-world attacks.</p>

They are in different sizes. We used the proposed methods to embed the samples into the models. Finally, we created 550 EvilModels. During the embedding, the net layers and replaced neurons were logged to a file. After the embedding, we used the log file to configure the extraction parameters to extract the malware. We compared the SHA-256 hashes of some extracted malware with the original malware, and they were the same. It means the embedding and extraction processes are all correct. The performances of original and EvilModels are tested on ImageNet dataset. The experiments were implemented with PyTorch 1.8 and CuDA 10.2, and run on Ubuntu 20.04 with 1 Intel Xeon Silver 4210 CPU (2.20GHz) and 4 GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU.</p>

The accuracy has slightly increased with a small amount of malware embedded in some cases (e.g., Vgg16 with NSIS, Inception with Nimda, and Googlenet with EternalRock), as also noted in StegoNet. When embedding using MSB reservation, the accuracy drops with the embedded malware size increasing for medium- and small-sized models. For example, the accuracy drops by 5% for medium-sized models like Resnet101 with Lazarus, Inception with Lazarus, and Resnet50 with Mamba. Theoretically, the maximum embedding rate of MSB reservation is 75%. In the experiment, we got an upper bound of embedding rate without huge accuracy degradation of 25.73% (Googlenet with Artemis).</p>

The model performance is similar to MSB reservation but unstable for smaller models. When a larger malware is embedded into a medium- or small-sized model, the performance drops significantly. For example, for Googlenet with Lazarus, the testing accuracy drops to 0.526% sharply. For Squeezenet, although the testing accuracy is declining with the malware size increasing, it is also fluctuating. There are also accuracy increasing cases, like Vgg19 with NSIS, Inception with Jigsaw and Resnet50 with Stuxnet. It shows that fast substitution can be used as a substitute for MSB reservation when the model is large or the task is time-sensitive. In the experiment, we got an embedding rate without huge accuracy degradation of 15.9% (Resnet18 with VikingHorde).</p>

Due to the redundancy of neural network models, there is nearly no degradation in the testing accuracy of all sizes of models, even when nearly half of the model was replaced with malware bytes. The accuracy fluctuates around 0.01% of the baseline.

Half substitution shows great compatibility with different models. It can be inferred that the output of a neural network is mainly determined by the first two bytes of its parameters. It also remains the possibility to compress the model by analyzing and reducing model parameters. Theoretically, the maximum embedding rate of half substitution is 50%. In the experiment, we reached close to the theoretical value at 48.52% (Squeezenet with Mamba).</p>

<div id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS2.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For the three methods, there is no apparent difference for larger models. However, when the embedding limitation is approaching for smaller models, the models’ performance is changed differently for different methods. Replacing three bytes harms more than replacing two bytes. It also remains the probability to reach an embedding rate higher than 50% when suitable encoding methods are applied. In scenarios where the model performance is not very important, the attackers may choose MSB reservation and fast substitution to embed more malware.</p>

The models were recognized as zip files by VirusTotal. Fifty-eight anti-virus engines were involved in the detection works, and no suspicion was detected. These detection results did not exceed our expectations because these models are not executable programs, nor do they have malware segments as detectable features. To sum up, the EvilModels will not cause alerts from common anti-virus engines and can be delivered evasively.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We applied four classic steganalysis methods to EvilModels: primary sets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, sample pairs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, RS analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and fusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. The primary sets perform steganalysis based on the statistical identity of certain sets of pixels in a sample. Sample pairs detect stego-samples based on a finite-state machine, selecting trace multisets of sample pairs. RS analysis detects steganography by inspecting differences in the number of regular and singular LSB stego-samples. Fusion is a combination of multiple methods for detecting the stego-samples.
We used a steganalysis toolset StegExpose <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> to analyze EvilModels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.SSS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We prepared some benign samples and EvilModels, and slightly adjusted all samples to grayscale images capable of StegoExpose. We used the stegomalware detection results from StegoExpose for comparison. Benign samples are composed of normal neural network models and common document files, and EvilModels include all 550 malware-embedded models.
Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.2.3 Half Substitution ‣ 4.2 Performance ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ EvilModel 2.0: Bringing Neural Network Models into Malware Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> shows the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve of the results. The x-axis represents the False Positive Rate, and the y-axis is the True Positive Rate. The AUC (Area Under Curve) represents the detection rate. The AUC for stegomalware is higher than the EvilModels, meaning four steganalysis methods work well on the stegomalware. The EvilModels’ AUCs are nearly higher than 0.5, which means the results are slightly better than random guesses, and the models have a higher evasive ability. Fast substitution has the smallest AUC of the three embedding methods, representing the highest evasiveness. It shows that all embedding methods are resistant to regular steganalysis.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing the entropy of clean and malware-embedded models may alternatively detect EvilModel. We selected models and malware samples of various sizes and compared the changes in the entropy of the model before and after embedding. We found that the entropy after embedding did not exhibit any changes compared with the original entropy. The results are presented in Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3.3 Entropy Analysis ‣ 4.3 Evasiveness ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ EvilModel 2.0: Bringing Neural Network Models into Malware Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> and Table <a href="#S4.T5" title="Table 5 ‣ 4.3.3 Entropy Analysis ‣ 4.3 Evasiveness ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ EvilModel 2.0: Bringing Neural Network Models into Malware Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. The y-axis represents the embedding methods with four models. The x-axis represents the embedded malware samples sorted by size in ascending order. “None” means no malware sample is embedded in the model (i.e., the clean model), and this column is the benchmark. A darker color indicates that the entropy is larger than the benchmark, and a lighter color indicates a smaller entropy. The gray blocks indicate that the model cannot embed a malware sample.

To better present the changes, we normalize the data with the benchmark for Fig. <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.3.3 Entropy Analysis ‣ 4.3 Evasiveness ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ EvilModel 2.0: Bringing Neural Network Models into Malware Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a>, that is,</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.SSS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are lighter and darker blocks, which means EvilModel’s entropy has increased and decreased cases. The block color does not change much when embedded with a small sample, meaning the entropy also does not change much. As the embedded malware size increases, the entropy shows an increasing or decreasing trend, as in the cases of VGG19 and Squeezenet.
If the defender knows the benchmark and change trend of a model, then the entropy can help detect EvilModels.
Otherwise, as the regularity and magnitude of changes are not apparent, entropy is not a significant indicator for detection.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The experiment demonstrated the feasibility of embedding malware into neural network models. The proposed methods have a higher malware embedding rate, low model performance impact, and no additional workload. <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Half substitution outperforms the other methods</span> with a high embedding rate and nearly not impacting the model performance. We can embed malware that is almost half the volume of the model into the model without model performance degradation. Small models can embed larger malware using a half substitution. Malware-embedded models can evade multiple security detection methods. It demonstrates the possibility of further cyber-attacks using the proposed methods. Combined with other advanced attack methods, it will bring more significant threats to computer security. The following section designs a trigger to activate the malware and shows a possible attack scenario in conjunction with half substitution and the trigger.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The penultimate layer of the model comprised 128 neurons. We have replaced the last neuron with a binary file.
As fast substitution has a higher impact on model performance, we used fast substitution to embed malware. A total of 2,049 parameters in this neuron were changed, including 2,048 connection weights and one bias.
The performance of the model was evaluated after embedding. The testing accuracy remained the same; however, the confidence of the outputs was enhanced. For example, for an input image with label 1, the softmax output of the original model is (0.110759, 0.889241), and that of the modified model is (0.062199, 0.937801). Confidence in label 1 was enhanced. We compared the output before and after modification of the penultimate layer and found that only the 128th output changed. The modified neuron output is larger than the original output. Because the values from the 128th neuron are mainly positive numbers, an increase in the values promotes the discrimination of the last layer, which results in higher confidence in the given samples.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Because only one neuron was modified here, the model’s performance was not significantly affected. Suppose the model has more neurons to be modified, and it happens to have more positive modifications. Then, this effect will accumulate and eventually be fed back to the model’s performance changes. However, modifying methods, such as MSB reservation and fast substitution, negatively affect model performance. Therefore, after many modifications to the neurons, the performance of the model will decline. The following section explores the impact of the modification on the model’s performance with another experiment.</p>

When a portion of the neurons was replaced, the model’s accuracy was less affected. For AlexNet with BN, when replacing 2,050 neurons (50%) in FC.1, the accuracy can still reach 93.11%, equivalent to 24MB of malware embedded. When over 2,900 neurons were replaced, the accuracy decreased below 90%. Subsequently, the accuracy decreases significantly as the number of replaced neurons increases. When all neurons were replaced, the accuracy dropped to around 10% (equivalent to random guessing). However, it seems “collapsed” for FC.0. The accuracy drops below 93% and 90% when over 40 and 160 neurons are replaced, respectively. For AlexNet without BN, FC.1 still performs better than FC.0.

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This section explores the impact of embedded malware on the different layers. We chose to embed malware in all layers of AlexNet. We used samples to replace different proportions of neurons in each layer and recorded their accuracy. Because different layers have varying parameters, we use percentages to represent the number of replaced neurons. The results are presented in Fig. <a href="#S6.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 6.2 Performance Impact on Different Layers ‣ 6 Embedding Capacity of Neural Network Model ‣ EvilModel 2.0: Bringing Neural Network Models into Malware Attacks" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>. With the deepening of the convolutional layer, the replacement of neurons has a more significant impact on the model performance. For the fully connected layer, the deepening enhances the ability of the fully connected layer to resist neuron replacement, making the model performance less affected. For both AlexNet with and without BN, FC.1 has outstanding performance in all layers. For fully connected layers, the layer closer to the output layer is more suitable for embedding.</p>

However, there is no need to use such higher-precision numbers as parameters in the model. We noticed that only two bytes are sufficient for a parameter in the experiments. Therefore, deep learning framework vendors should consider changing the default data type of the parameters and lowering the precision of the numbers. Thus, this potential attack would not be eliminated, but it becomes more challenging for the attackers to use the model because its performance would drop quickly when the parameters are changed.</p>

The experiment assumed that defenders knew the embedded malware sample. The defenders can extract the model parameters from different layers, convert them to hex bytes, and compare them with the malware bytes. If malware is embedded in the network layer, the parameters hex bytes and malware bytes will overlap. EvilModel can be detected through the overlap rates of the different layers. We used the Mobilenet clean model and EvilModel for proof-of-concept detection.

The “Cx” is the convolution layer, and the “F1.x” represents the fully connected layer. The overlap rate in the F1.1 layer is significantly higher than in other layers, meaning that malware is mainly embedded in the F1.1 layer of the Mobilenet model. Although it is difficult to know the embedded malware in real scenarios, constructing a malware collection and detecting the overlap rate individually is a mature method. Thus, the experimental results indicate that malware embedded in a neural network model can be detected.</p>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper proposes three methods to embed malware into neural network models with a high embedding rate, low impact on the model performance, and no extra effort. We applied the embedding methods on ten mainstream models with 19 malware samples to demonstrate the feasibility of the methods. With half substitution applied, nearly half of the model could be replaced with malware bytes without degrading performance, reaching an embedding rate of 48.52%. A quantitative method is proposed to evaluate the existing embedding methods with the embedding rate, impact on models, and embedding effort. This paper also designed an implicit trigger and presented a stealthy attack using half substitution to demonstrate the potential threat of the proposed scenario. This paper further explored the embedding capability of a neural network model and studied the fault tolerance of different network layers through an experiment on AlexNet. We also restored the lost performance by retraining the model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This paper shows that a large number of parameters in regular neural network models can be replaced with malware bytes or other types of information while maintaining the model’s performance with no sense. Neural network models are ready to be carriers of malware, and this issue will be a significant threat to network security, which requires security researchers to prepare in advance. Network attack and defense are interdependent, and it is worthwhile for the security community to discover potential threats and respond to them with practical solutions as early as possible. We believe that the threats discovered in this paper will contribute to future protection efforts, and we also hope the countermeasures presented in this paper will be helpful.</p>
