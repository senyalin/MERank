Unlike previous efforts in the field, that fit only the parameters to the fixed functional forms, we instead use a novel algorithm to search the space of many possible functional forms. While a follow-on practical procedure will use experimental and ab inito data to find an optimal functional form for a force-field, we first validate the approach using a manufactured solution. This validation has the advantage of a well-defined metric of success. We manufactured a training set of atomic coordinate data with an associated set of global energies using the well-known Lennard-Jones inter-atomic potential. We performed an automatic functional form fitting procedure starting with a population of random functions, using a genetic programming functional formulation, and a parallel tempering Metropolis-based optimization algorithm.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Classical Molecular Dynamics [MD] and other molecular mechanics simulations have become important computational tools in the nano-scale design of novel materials, and have brought insight into structure and function of bio-molecules. All such simulations require accurate and computationally efficient forms for the inter-atomic potential/force function. Force-fields that serve that role are typically physics-intuition-based functions of inter-atomic distances and bonding structure. Classical force-field functions represent extensive work in invention and validation, using physical insight combined with experimental and other sources of information. Computationally, construction of a force-field can be viewed as a fitting process, where successful functional forms of the force-field best ”fit” the available data. Given a clear metric of ”fitness”, fitting a classical force-field is a well-defined optimization procedure. It requires a definition of a mutable representation for the function and parameters, a quantifiable ”fitness” criterion, and a set of ergodic evolution operators.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Until now, all the functional forms for such functions were generated by physical intuition, and only their parameters (i.e. multiplicative constants, additive constants, and exponents) were optimized. Each such process, done manually, represents many man-years of highly qualified labor, and often meets with failure. This important and laborious task clearly calls for automation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the case of parameter-only fitting, a useful representation for the problem is an ordered set of real numbers, with each number acting as a parameter for a fixed functional form. The evolution operators, in this case, are generalized linear transformations that treat the ordered set of numbers as a vector in real space and search for the vector’s optimal size and direction. A number of research efforts have attacked the partial problem of automatically fitting the numerical parameters in the fixed functional forms, successfully obtaining better fits to the objective function based on a training set.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As we become increasingly interested in complex multi-species systems, and look more critically to the quantitative prediction of their material properties, stringent requirements lead to the need for more complicated functional forms. Optimization of the functional form itself requires a substantial change in the methodology. Such more complicated functions are embedded in a very large combinatorial space. Researchers find it difficult, if not impossible, to develop an intuition for the relationships between the various functions and the ever-expanding training set. An automatic functional form fitting method is clearly called for.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We use the Genetic Programming formalism as a starting point for such a fitting algorithm. Genetic Programming [GP] <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> uses a library of elementary operators to build a population of hierarchical computer programs, represented as operator trees. We find that this description of the functional form provides us with maximum generality of the functional expression. We choose a minimal set of algebraic operators: <math id="S1.p5.1.m1.5" class="ltx_math_unparsed" alttext="\{+,-,*,/,\hat{},||\}" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p5.1.m1.5a"><mrow id="S1.p5.1.m1.5b"><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.6">{</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S1.p5.1.m1.1.1">+</mo><mo rspace="0em" id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.7">,</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S1.p5.1.m1.2.2">−</mo><mo rspace="0em" id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.8">,</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S1.p5.1.m1.3.3">*</mo><mo rspace="0em" id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.9">,</mo><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S1.p5.1.m1.4.4">/</mo><mo id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.10">,</mo><mover accent="true" id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.5"><mi id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.5.2"></mi><mo id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.5.1">^</mo></mover><mo id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.11">,</mo><mo fence="false" rspace="0.167em" stretchy="false" id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.12">|</mo><mo fence="false" rspace="0.167em" stretchy="false" id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.13">|</mo><mo stretchy="false" id="S1.p5.1.m1.5.14">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p5.1.m1.5c">\{+,-,*,/,\hat{},||\}</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S1.p5.1.m1.5d">{ + , - , * , / , over^ start_ARG end_ARG , | | }</annotation></semantics></math>. If only the algebraic operators are used, the resulting tree becomes an algebraic expression with variable or constant number input at the leaves. The population of such trees is evolved using a Genetic Algorithm [GA] to improve the fitness of the tree population according to a user-defined fitness criterion. A small set of mutation operators provides a way to evolve the trees in the functional space. We describe the model in more detail in section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="2.1 Functional and Genetic Programming ‣ 2 Method ‣ Searching for Globally Optimal Functional Forms for Inter-Atomic Potentials Using Parallel Tempering and Genetic Programming." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.1</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In the fitting problem, the training set, which underlies the fitness function, requires careful definition, robust design, and much labor. The objective function is typically based on a set of sets of atomic positions with an associated set of observables, obtained either experimentally or via  <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ab initio</span> simulations. For validation purposes, we construct a manufactured training set using an existing classical force-field. Such a manufactured solution provides the advantage of a clearly defined objective in terms of a known answer. We leave the somewhat philosophical discussion of the difference between the manufactured and a real system until section <a href="#S4" title="4 Discussion ‣ Searching for Globally Optimal Functional Forms for Inter-Atomic Potentials Using Parallel Tempering and Genetic Programming." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. We choose the Lennard-Jones pair potential as the basis of the training set. The training set is a set of boxes randomly populated with atoms. The potential energy of each box is calculated by summing the the Lennard-Jones pair potential function over all pairs of atoms within a specified cut-off distance. The list of pairwise distances for each box together with the associated box energies serve as a basis for the fitness function, that is in turn used to evaluate the fitness of the trees in the algorithm. The details of the training set and fitness function construction can be found in section <a href="#S2.SS3" title="2.3 Training Set and Fitness Function ‣ 2 Method ‣ Searching for Globally Optimal Functional Forms for Inter-Atomic Potentials Using Parallel Tempering and Genetic Programming." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3</span></a>, while the overall algorithm is described in section <a href="#S2" title="2 Method ‣ Searching for Globally Optimal Functional Forms for Inter-Atomic Potentials Using Parallel Tempering and Genetic Programming." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">The Lennard-Jones functional form, which is the target function, minimally appears as a four-level tree in our representation this is wrong. The space of all possible trees of this size is very large (see section <a href="#S4" title="4 Discussion ‣ Searching for Globally Optimal Functional Forms for Inter-Atomic Potentials Using Parallel Tempering and Genetic Programming." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). The energy landscape is rough, discontinuous, and littered with local minima. We have developed a powerful optimization method which is a hybrid between a GA and Parallel Tempering Metropolis to enable efficient search on a massively parallel cluster architecture. The method evolves a set of populations of trees according to a scheme that combines mutation with a Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. Each population is assigned a different effective temperature and trees are periodically exchanged between populations. The details of the algorithm can be found in section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2 Parallel Tempering ‣ 2 Method ‣ Searching for Globally Optimal Functional Forms for Inter-Atomic Potentials Using Parallel Tempering and Genetic Programming." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a>.</p>

The concept of a <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">first-order function</span>, meaning a function that operates on functions, was defined in this context, though it has been widely used before without formal definition. For example, a <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">derivative</span> function takes one function to another function. In this formal setting, Genetic Programming is a case of a <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">first-order function</span>, that typically operates on <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pure</span> (no side-effects) functions to construct and refine composite computer programs.</p>

Pass-through involves selecting the fittest tree that has not already been passed though from the old population and copying it into the new population. Cross-over involves creating a new tree by combining two parent trees selcted from the old population. Tournament selection is used to choose parent trees from the old population: four trees are selected with equal probability from the old population, and the tree with highest fitness is selected. To perform the actual crossover operation, a depth level from the first parent is selected, with the restriction that the node is not the root (which would not mix up the trees at all) or at maximum depth (which would not cause enough change). A depth level is then selected from the second parent, with the same restrictions. A randomly chosen subtree rooted at the selected depth level is then chopped from the first parent, and replaced with a randomly chosen subtree rooted at the selected depth level in the second parent, producing one new child tree containing parts of both parents. An additional restriction is that the child tree must satisfy the minimum and maximum allowable tree depths.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In the mutation stage, each new tree is either mutated or left alone with equal probability, without regard for fitness or how the tree was created. On a tree that is mutated, a node is selected, which can include the root or a leaf. The node is selected with equal probability from all nodes, meaning that there is a higher probability to select a node near the leaves than to select a node near the root; this was done to give a preference for small adjustments to the parameters rather than drastic changes to the entire functional form. The subtree rooted at this node is chopped, and a new random subtree is made from scratch, restricted to keeping the entire tree within legal depth limits. Thus, on average 1/4 of the new trees are made by crossover, 1/4 by crossover and mutation, 1/4 by mutation alone (pass-through followed by mutation), and 1/4 are retained from the previous generation.</p>

Metropolis compares each old tree against the new tree in the same position in the list. This is a simple variant of Tournament Selection. The new tree is accepted into the population if it is better then an old one, and only occasionally otherwise according to the Boltzmann probability:</p>

The fundamental idea is to use the high-temperature replicas to sample the system phase space at a coarse level with the low-temperature replicas refining the states in local traps. In this way, a hybrid of local and global sampling is achieved. Later changes to the method replace partial information exchange with a complete state swap. Many parameters of the method have come under scrutiny since.

Each box has an associated box energy which depends on the positions of all the atoms in the box. In the current work, the box energy is given by a sum of pair potential functions, evaluated for all pairs of atoms lying within a given cut-off distance. Periodic boundary conditions are used and pairs of atoms closer than a minimum interaction distance are ignored. The pair potential was chosen to be the well-known Lennard-Jones potential function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S3.p1.8" class="ltx_p">The purpose of this study was to test whether the GP approach was capable of discovering accurate potential energy functions that replicate the true potential energy surface. Typically, information about the true potential energy surface is obtained by using quantum mechanics calculations to evaluate the energy of small configurations of atoms. Hence, we chose as our test case 10 boxes containing 10 randomly positioned particles.

All trees were required to have minimum depths of 3 and maximum depths of 4. The calculations were run on a cluster of 100 AMD Opteron 2.2 GHz processors with Quadrics interconnects. For the runs with 10,000 individuals per population, each generation required about 100 seconds. For 50,000 indiviuals, the time per generation was about 5 times longer. Most of this time was spent in the evaluation of box energies.</p>

Clearly, this is a non-trivial problem. For this reason, it is not surprising that we appear to be the first group to attempt an unsupervised automated approach to finding functional forms for force-fields. Previous efforts at unsupervised force-field fitting have been restricted to parameter optimization, given a fixed functional form. We succeeded because we were able to use relatively large computational resources, and we used a very robust optimization method.</p>

<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">It is important to emphasize that while the surrogate test problem used in this study had a known solution, it nonetheless was representative of many potential energy surfaces where accurate functional forms are unknown. We deliberately chose a training set that closely resembled data generated by quantum density functional theory calculations of potential energy. Given the success of the method in the current study, we now intend to apply the method to some of the many atomic systems for which existing force-fields have been found lacking.</p>
