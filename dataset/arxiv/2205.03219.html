<p id="id5.id1" class="ltx_p">Recommending a sequence of activities for an ongoing case
requires that the recommendations conform to the underlying business
process and meet the performance goal of either completion time or process outcome. Existing work on next activity prediction can predict the future activity but cannot provide guarantees of the prediction being conformant or meeting the goal. Hence, we propose a goal-oriented next best activity recommendation. Our proposed framework uses a deep learning model to predict the next best activity and an estimated value of a goal given the activity. A reinforcement learning method explores the sequence of activities based on the estimates likely to meet one or more goals. We further address a real-world problem of multiple goals
by introducing an additional reward function to balance the outcome of a recommended activity and satisfy the goal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four real-world datasets with different characteristics. The results show that the recommendations from our proposed approach outperform in goal satisfaction and conformance compared to the existing state-of-the-art next best activity recommendation techniques.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There has been a growing interest in the research community in providing decision support with studies focusing on prescriptive process monitoring and naturally extending predictive process monitoring (PPM). The focus of research in PPM has led to investigating many deep learning approaches having improved accuracy as compared to the classical machine learning algorithms.  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. However, while PPM is capable of identifying the likelihood that an ongoing case can get delayed, execute a non-conformant event, or may have a long execution trace, it cannot suggest or prescribe the optimal execution of a case that can avoid an undesirable outcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Consequently, prescriptive process monitoring has addressed some of the problems. One approach is to prescribe an intervention by triggering an alarm when the probability that a case will lead to an undesired outcome is above a threshold <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. An alternative approach is to recommend actions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Nonetheless, there is limited work on recommending actions in the context of business goals  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. Goals are often defined for any real world business process based on Key Performance Indicators (KPI) such as cost, quality, or time.
Additionally, these goals can be contradictory. Consider an example of the loan application process - completing the loan sequence with limited actions (corresponding to activities) and approving a loan application within a stipulated time may not meet the quality requirements as the loan may be approved without checking an applicant’s credit score. Hence, the goals of completion time and quality are contradictory. Moreover, the sequence of activities recommended must also conform to certain policies or regulations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. </p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework to optimize sequences of decisions for long-term outcomes. For example, given an ongoing case, if a decision needs to be made on the next activity, each choice can affect the KPI (such as the completion time) and eventually the goal (i.e., did it complete within a stipulated time). An RL algorithm can choose the next activity (known as action) according to its policy based on the KPI estimation and receive immediate outcome (known as reward).
Hence, we propose using RL to recommend goal-oriented next best activity that conform to certain specified constraints. </p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There are various challenges to use RL in the context of a goal-oriented and conformant activity sequence prediction. First, the action space varies as there are constraints on what activities can or cannot occur. Next, the RL model tends to choose a path that satisfies the goal without considering the outcome. It could be possible that, for instance, the model has to choose a path with the least duration and the least duration path is an undesired outcome (e.g., rejecting a loan application). In such scenarios, the model would recommend an undesirable outcome for all cases, i.e., rejecting all the loan applications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Therefore, considering the challenges discussed above, in this work, we aim to address the following research question: <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Given an ongoing case, can we learn from historical executions to recommend the next best activity (and the sequence) that is goal-oriented and conformant</span>.

Our framework supports: (1) Deep learning model to predict the estimated value of KPI that forms the basis of RL exploration. (2) Deep RL on-policy method to recommend next activity that is conformant to the process model.
(3) Balancing reward mechanism to mitigate the possible bias of the recommended sequence outcome.</p>

<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Predictive process monitoring:</h5>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A large body of existing work focuses on predicting the next activity and the most likely remaining sequence of activities (suffix). Most of the recent work here relies on Recurrent architectures such as LSTMs for predicting the next activity and remaining time of cases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Additionally, the use of transformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> has been explored that is efficient to train and can handle large sequences. Further, a generative adversarial architecture (GAN) has been proposed, where the generator produces sequences from random noise and the discriminator differentiates between real sequences and the ones created by the generator in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. The objective is to predict the sequence of activities at any point in the case and detect the likelihood of an undesired outcome, but they do not provide recommendation that can prevent an undesired outcome.</p>

<section id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Intervention-based recommendations:</h5>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Early work on prescriptive process monitoring proposed a mechanism for generating alarms that could lead to interventions and mitigate or prevent undesired outcomes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>. In their work, Teinemaa et al. propose an alarm system comprising of two components: 1) a probabilistic classifier that estimates the likelihood of an undesired outcome, and 2) an alarming threshold component that alarms when the likelihood of the undesired outcome is at least a threshold. The optimal alarming threshold is based on the cost of an intervention. Metzger et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> use an RL algorithm to automatically learn when to trigger process adaptations based on the predictions. Recent work proposed a framework that recommends when to apply an intervention (treatment) to an ongoing case to decrease its cycle time by building causal models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Orthogonal random forests trained on historical traces is used to estimate the effect of a treatment (or intervention) on the reduction in cycle time, given the current state of a case. In these approaches, the recommendation of the intervention or treatment is binary and does not recommend an optimal next best activity or suffix.</p>

<section id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h5 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Suffix recommendations:</h5>

<div id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Recent work on prescriptive process monitoring proposes the next best event recommendation that is optimized for a given KPI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>. A DL model is trained to predict next activities and the KPI values. For an ongoing case, the suffix and the KPI values are predicted. A set of <math id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1c">k</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.1.m1.1d">italic_k</annotation></semantics></math> nearest neighbors of the predicted suffix is chosen from historical data as candidate suffixes. They are then passed to a business process simulation model to reduce the risk of non-conformant activities and recommend the best suffix. Non-conformant activities are simply discarded in candidate suffixes. But, when all candidate suffixes are non-conformant, the predicted suffix is returned as the best action. In this particular case, the recommendations would be non-conformant. Hence, this work also does not guarantee conformant recommendations. Moreover, a pre-defined <math id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="k" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">k</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑘</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.2.m2.1c">k</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1.2.m2.1d">italic_k</annotation></semantics></math> neighbors in the search space is needed to select the suffix meeting the goal. Therefore, we distinguish our approach by its ability to support multiple goals (or KPIs) and explore a search space of optimal paths while providing conformant recommendations using RL. An approach using Memory augmented neural networks (MANN) recommends suffixes by learning from historical data labeled as meeting or deviating from the goal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. In a later work, Khan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> use an RL algorithm to recommend suffixes that meet a goal. While the authors use RL to recommend the best actions, they do not consider multiple conflicting goals with the additional constraint of ensuring conformant execution paths.</p>

The primary requirement is to ensure that the predicted activity sequences conform to the discovered business process DFG.
The absence of DFG could lead to recommending non-conformant sequences. This is highly undesirable as non-conformance can lead to violation of regulations and legal obligations. Hence, we use the DFG to guide the activity sequence prediction model and learn only the sequences that conform to the business process. </p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Key performance indicators (KPI) such as cost, time, or quality must be measured for each event in a trace.
Predicting KPI values after executing each activity of a partial sequence helps in estimating their corresponding goal value and checking whether unfolding the execution of the entire sequence of activities by choosing that specific activity would violate the goal or not. The KPI prediction model is used to explore different activities and choose the ones that will satisfy the goal. We need to consider that the chosen activity may not satisfy the goal at the current point in time but could eventually satisfy it when the case ends. As depicted in Figure <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4 Approach ‣ Goal-Oriented Next Best Activity Recommendation using Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, we train the KPI prediction model with the input as: (1) the partially completed activity sequence and (2) the activity chosen by the RL agent (discussed in Section <a href="#S4.SS3.SSS2" title="4.3.2 RL Agent ‣ 4.3 Goal-Oriented Model using Reinforcement Learning ‣ 4 Approach ‣ Goal-Oriented Next Best Activity Recommendation using Reinforcement Learning" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3.2</span></a>). The objective is to predict the KPI given the partially completed activity sequence with their KPI values and the next chosen activity. Existing KPI prediction models only consider the partially completed activity sequence as input. As we require to explore all conformant paths, our model considers the partial sequence and the next likely activity. </p>

Each event in DFG and its corresponding KPI value becomes the state. The action space would vary at every state according to the possible actions obtained from business process DFG.

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">The RL agent learns sequences from the input data. We want the RL agent to predict activity sequences that conform to the DFG. We also need to match the outcome of the sequence with the ground truth sequence outcomes in order to mitigate the skewness during learning. The ground truth sequences should also conform to the discovered DFG. But, often, the discovered DFG from the event log is an approximate representation and hence does reflect all the activity sequences <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.

<p id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.3" class="ltx_p">First, we train the KPI model. It is then used by the RL agent to obtain the predicted KPI values for each action it chooses.
The input to the KPI model is the partial sequence consisting of the first activity and subsequent activities chosen by the RL agent and the current action chosen by the RL agent to explore. The model then predicts the KPI corresponding to the current action chosen. Since the action space, i.e., the set of available actions at each state, varies according to the business process DFG, the exploration is based on the available actions, and the best action is chosen. PPO agent explores by sampling actions according to its stochastic policy, which keeps on changing as it learns. That means that the agent learns on the go and its experience changes the policy and hence the exploration.
The next best action is chosen sequentially after each activity is predicted until the RL agent predicts the <math id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\langle EOS\rangle" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">⟨</mo><mrow id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml">E</mi><mo id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">⁢</mo><mi id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml">O</mi><mo id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1a" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml">⁢</mo><mi id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.4" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.4.cmml">S</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.2">delimited-⟨⟩</csymbol><apply id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1"><times id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.2">𝐸</ci><ci id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.3">𝑂</ci><ci id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.4.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.1.1.4">𝑆</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1c">\langle EOS\rangle</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S5.SS3.SSS4.p2.1.m1.1d">⟨ italic_E italic_O italic_S ⟩</annotation></semantics></math>.

PPO being an on-policy method, performs way better than DQN because of its capability to learn stochastic policies and efficiently handle complex Q-functions.
Maskable-PPO outperforms the large negative reward approach because a large negative reward hinders the exploration of the RL agent by shifting the aim to avoid non-conformant paths rather than focusing on choosing goal-satisfying paths.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we proposed a reinforcement learning (RL) based method to predict the next best activity (and sequence) that satisfies specific goals and conforms to certain constraints. We motivate the need for such a framework in the application context of real-world business process executions. We further propose a method to handle conflicting goals. Our work is the first to build a goal-oriented next best activity (and sequence) recommendation model to the best of our knowledge. We would extend the current framework to include multiple goals as a part of future work. We also plan to incorporate the effect of data attributes present in the logs on recommendations. Further, we plan to incorporate our work in a decision recommendation platform that recommends next best actions to the knowledge workers based on goal satisfiability.</p>
