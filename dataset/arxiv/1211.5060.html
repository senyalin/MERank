<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">A study on filtering aspects of airborne wind energy generators is presented. This class of renewable energy systems aims to convert the aerodynamic forces generated by tethered wings, flying in closed paths transverse to the wind flow, into electricity.
The accurate reconstruction of the wing’s position, velocity and heading is of fundamental importance for the automatic control of these kinds of systems.
The difficulty of the estimation problem arises from the nonlinear dynamics, wide speed range, large accelerations and fast changes of direction that the wing experiences during operation. It is shown that the overall nonlinear system has a specific structure allowing its partitioning into sub-systems, hence leading to a series of simpler filtering problems. Different sensor setups are then considered, and the related sensor fusion algorithms are presented.
The results of experimental tests carried out with a small-scale prototype and wings of different sizes are discussed. The designed filtering algorithms rely purely on kinematic laws, hence they are independent from features like wing area, aerodynamic efficiency, mass, etc. Therefore, the presented results are representative also of systems with larger size and different wing design, different number of tethers and/or rigid wings.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">High-altitude wind is a vast, still untapped renewable source of energy that has received an increasing attention in the last decade, from both industry and academia, with the ongoing development of a series of technologies that fall under the umbrella name of airborne wind energy. While many concepts of airborne wind energy generators were present already in patents and publications in the late 1970s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, it is only in recent years that an increasing number of research groups and companies started to develop operating prototypes to convert the energy of high-altitude wind, blowing up to 1000 m from the ground, into electricity (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>). The activities carried out worldwide in the last six years allowed to define and assess, through theoretical, numerical and experimental research, some common grounds of airborne wind energy (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> for an overview), as well as its potentials to provide cheap electricity in large quantities, available practically everywhere in the world <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Airborne wind energy generators exploit the motion of wings flying fast in the so-called crosswind conditions, i.e. roughly perpendicularly to the wind flow, and linked to the ground by flexible lines. The aerodynamic forces generated by the wing are then converted into electricity using one of several possible approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Control engineering plays a crucial role in airborne wind energy technologies, since, differently from conventional wind energy based on wind turbines, there is no passive, rigid structure that constrains the path of the wing and imposes its crosswind motion. Rather, this task has to be accomplished by an active control system that keeps track of the wing trajectory and issues suitable control inputs through actuators. In the last six years, the problem of control design for airborne wind energy generators has been studied by several research groups and companies, leading to a quite significant series of theoretical and numerical studies (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>) as well as experimental tests, of which few works in the literature report measured data <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">All of the mentioned control approaches rely on the availability of a series of variables to be used for feedback, most notably the wing’s three-dimensional position and velocity. The problem of estimating with sufficiently good accuracy and limited lag these quantities is therefore of paramount importance in the field, however in the literature there are only few works on this topic, highlighting the specific issues that need to be addressed and providing either numerical or experimental results (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, concerned with the navigation algorithms of large towing kites for seagoing vessels).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we contribute to fill this gap by providing a formulation of the estimation problem and by analyzing two different sensor setups and the related sensor fusion algorithms. In particular, the first sensor setup implies the use of a commercial Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), installed on the wing and equipped with accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, a GPS, and a barometer. We propose two algorithms for this sensor setup: the first approach is a quite standard linear observer, while the second one introduces a nonlinear correction to account for the specific kinematic constraints of the considered application.
In the second sensor setup, we consider the use of a line angle measurement system in addition to the accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers.
The presented study is focused on the estimation of the wing’s position and of its “velocity angle”, which is a variable well-suited for automatic control strategies, when the wing is flying fast in crosswind conditions (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> for more details on the automatic control design). We present experimental results obtained with a small-scale prototype operating with a fixed line length of 30 m and equipped with an IMU and a line angle measurement system, which we developed and built ad-hoc for this application. The equations employed in the design of the observer are based purely on kinematics, hence they are exact (i.e. they are not affected by uncertainty in the system’s parameters) and independent from system’s characteristics like the wing area, aerodynamic efficiency, mass, etc. Therefore, the presented experimental results are representative also of systems with larger wing size and different design, including systems with different number of tethers and/or rigid wings.

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A flexible wing (inflatable power kites are used in the experiments) is linked by three lines to a ground unit (GU). In normal flight conditions, the wing’s trajectory evolves downwind with respect to the GU.
The GU is fixed to the ground and it is equipped with actuators, able to influence the wing’s path: a human operator or an automatic control algorithm commands the actuators in order to obtain “figure-eight” crosswind paths, which maximize the generated forces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. This paper is devoted to the problem of estimating in real-time, in the described flying conditions, the wing’s position as well as its “velocity angle”. In the next section, we provide a formal definition of these variables and we introduce the related notation and model equations.</p>

Instead, the energy needed for the operation of the system is drawn from batteries installed on the GU. The use of a fixed, short lines’ length (as compared with the intended operating conditions of this kind of systems, ranging from 100 to 1000 m of lines’ length) does not impair the significance of the presented study, rather it increases it, for ar least four reasons: first, airborne wind energy systems operate with very low line reel-out speed as compared with the other components of the wing’s velocity vector, so that the behavior of the wing does not change significantly between fixed line length and variable line length; second, the optimal operation of airborne wind energy generators is obtained with a constant line speed (ideally equal to one third of the wind speed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>) and the settings considered here can be regarded to as a particular case of such operating conditions, i.e. with constant line speed equal to zero; third, the use of fixed lines’ length yields the largest possible forces for given wind conditions, hence the highest accelerations and angular velocities, making the estimation problem more challenging; finally, the use of short lines implies that the wing’s path is contained in a small portion of the aerial space, with consequent much more frequent changes of direction and inversions of motion, again increasing the difficulty of the filtering problem.</p>

Indeed these features influence the motion of the wing through complex, infinite dimensional nonlinear dynamics, whose inputs are the steering command given by the control system and the (unmeasured) wind, yet such dynamics are totally irrelevant for our scope if a measure or estimate of the acceleration <math id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\vec{\ddot{p}}_{G}(t)" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.cmml"><msub id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.cmml"><mover accent="true" id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.cmml"><mover accent="true" id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2.2" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2.2.cmml">p</mi><mo id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2.1" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2.1.cmml">¨</mo></mover><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.1" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.1.cmml">→</mo></mover><mi id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.3" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.3.cmml">G</mi></msub><mo id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.1" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.1.cmml">⁢</mo><mrow id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.3.2" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.3.2.1" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.1.cmml">t</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.3.2.2" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.cmml">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1b"><apply id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2"><times id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.1"></times><apply id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2">subscript</csymbol><apply id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2"><ci id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.1">→</ci><apply id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2"><ci id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2.1">¨</ci><ci id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.2.2.2">𝑝</ci></apply></apply><ci id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.2.2.3">𝐺</ci></apply><ci id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1.1">𝑡</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1c">\vec{\ddot{p}}_{G}(t)</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.SS2.p6.3.m3.1d">over→ start_ARG over¨ start_ARG italic_p end_ARG end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_G end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_t )</annotation></semantics></math>, which is the input to our model, is available.

Given the short length of the wing’s lines and high forces developed in crosswind motion (typically ranging from 500 N to 3000 N in our experiments), the hypotheses above are reasonable in the considered application. We provide some considerations on the validity of such assumptions in the presence of longer lines in the discussion in section <a href="#S5" title="5 Discussion and conclusions ‣ On sensor fusion for airborne wind energy systems This manuscript is a preprint of a paper submitted for possible publication on the IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology and is subject to IEEE Copyright.

Moreover, it can be noted that the accuracy of the first two approaches gets worse as the wind speed increases. Since the wing’s speed depends linearly on the wind speed (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>), this results indicate that the GPS performance get worse as the wing movements get faster and changes of direction are more frequent.

The reason for this result is that the barometric altitude reading is influenced by the change of air pressure due to the increased wing speed and hence increased airflow on the barometer, which is tuned in static conditions. This phenomenon can be compensated by implementing a correction e.g. based on the wing’s speed or line force, which are related to the airflow.</p>

Although the control system (designed according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>) can still operate satisfactorily in this case, its performance get worse.

The reason of such a difference lies in the fact that the inertial sensors of the IMU allow to anticipate the wing’s movement, hence reducing the lag in the filtered variables. In summary, while the third approach provides estimates that are good enough for feedback control also if the IMU is not used, the fusion of the inertial sensors of the IMU with the line angle measurement system yields the best performance.

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented a study on the problem of sensor fusion for tethered wings to be used in airborne wind energy systems, focusing in particular on crosswind flight conditions. We designed three algorithms to estimate the wing’s position and velocity angle, using different sensors, and we applied them in experimental tests.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.5" class="ltx_p">The approaches and the results presented in this paper are directly significant for small-scale airborne wind energy systems when operating with relatively short lines. Moreover, as already mentioned, the use of a kinematic model renders the approaches suitable for virtually any size and type of wing. The main underlying assumption for the validity of the approaches is the presence of a straight tether linking the wing to the ground. In our experimental setup, with 30-m-long lines and force values ranging typically from 500 N to 3000 N in crosswind conditions, this was always the case. In such conditions, our results indicate that the techniques based on GPS are not usable in practice for the purpose of feedback control in crosswind motion. This holds in particular for the first approach for the position estimate, and for both the first and second approaches for the <math id="S5.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\gamma" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p2.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S5.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S5.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">γ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p2.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S5.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p2.3.m3.1.1">𝛾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p2.3.m3.1c">\gamma</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S5.p2.3.m3.1d">italic_γ</annotation></semantics></math> estimate. Hence, our results suggest that the use of accurate and fast position measurement devices, like the line angle sensor, are essential to obtain high accuracy when the lines are relatively short w.r.t. the wing speed. More specifically, the GPS is affected by poor accuracy (which can be partially improved by exploiting the kinematic constraint given by the tether) and by a (time-varying) delay, typically about 0.2 s but up to 1 s in some cases. Finally, we also showed with experimental results that the fusion of inertial sensors with the position measurements yields the best performance in estimating the position, velocity and velocity angle of the wing, also when an accurate line angle sensor is used.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This situation is likely to change when longer lines are used, so that the additional line drag and weight might reduce the traction force exerted by the wing, giving rise to line sagging. Clearly, at which length of the lines this might happen depends on the wing size, efficiency and wind speed. In such conditions, the accuracy of the line angle sensor decreases, hence making the third approach less effective, however on the other hand we expect the performance of the first and second approach to improve. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that the accuracy of the GPS would be the same in absolute values also with longer tether length, hence yielding smaller errors in terms of angular positions, which are the ones that matter for feedback control in several approaches <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. This would hold particularly if the span of the flying path increases with the length of the lines (e.g. if the same trajectory in the <math id="S5.p3.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(\phi,\theta)" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p3.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S5.p3.1.m1.2.3.2" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p3.1.m1.2.3.2.1" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">(</mo><mi id="S5.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ϕ</mi><mo id="S5.p3.1.m1.2.3.2.2" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mi id="S5.p3.1.m1.2.2" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.2.2.cmml">θ</mi><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.p3.1.m1.2.3.2.3" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">)</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p3.1.m1.2b"><interval closure="open" id="S5.p3.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.2.3.2"><ci id="S5.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.1.1">italic-ϕ</ci><ci id="S5.p3.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.p3.1.m1.2.2">𝜃</ci></interval></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p3.1.m1.2c">(\phi,\theta)</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S5.p3.1.m1.2d">( italic_ϕ , italic_θ )</annotation></semantics></math> plane is kept). Such a consideration suggests that the capability of tracking the wing with sufficiently good accuracy might be a design constraint for the size of the flown trajectories. Moreover, the use of GPS sensors with higher performance (e.g. differential GPS) can certainly improve the accuracy obtained with the first two approaches, which then could be mixed with the third one. This represents an interesting line of research, that can be pursued only with a larger testing setup with full reel-out capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Focusing again on the third approach, eventual line sag could be also detected and corrected by exploiting the barometric altitude reading and the measure of the forces acting on the lines, as well as other additional measurements like onboard airspeed, which is also related to the generated force: from our own experience and from discussions with several researchers working in the field of airborne wind energy, line sag is almost absent during crosswind flight if the forces are large enough. This aspects provides further design and operation criteria for AWE systems: the chosen length of the tethers and reel-out speed should be matched with the characteristics of the wing (like size and efficiency) and with the wind conditions, in order to make sure that the load on the lines is large enough, relative to their length, to allow good position measurements from the ground with a line angle sensor. This point provides also a further reason to investigate the phenomenon of line sag, not only for the sake of deriving more accurate models for numerical simulations, but also for the purpose of estimation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Last, we think that the use of larger and heavier wings would also yield better accuracy with the first two approaches, due to larger flight paths (whose radius increases approximately linearly with the wing span) and higher inertia that should lead to an improvement in the relative GPS accuracy.
