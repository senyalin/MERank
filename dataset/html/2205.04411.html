<p id="id4.id1" class="ltx_p">Due to the popularity
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques,
we are witnessing an increasing number of
backdoor injection attacks that are designed to
maliciously threaten Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) causing misclassification.
Although there exist various defense
methods that can effectively erase backdoors from DNNs, they
greatly suffer from both high
Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a non-negligible loss in Benign Accuracy (BA).
Inspired by the observation that
a backdoored DNN tends to
form a new cluster in its
feature spaces for
poisoned data, in this paper we propose a novel
two-stage backdoor defense method, named MCLDef, based on Model-Contrastive Learning (MCL).
In the first stage, our approach
performs trigger inversion
based on trigger synthesis, where the resultant
trigger can be used
to generate poisoned data.
In the second stage,
under the guidance of MCL and our defined positive and negative pairs,
MCLDef can purify the backdoored
model by pulling the
feature representations of poisoned data towards those of
their clean data counterparts.
Due to the shrunken cluster of poisoned data,
the backdoor formed by end-to-end supervised learning
is eliminated.
Comprehensive experimental results show that,
with only 5% of clean data,
MCLDef significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art
defense methods by up to 95.79% reduction in ASR, while
in most cases the BA degradation can be controlled within less than 2%. Our code is available at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WeCanShow/MCL" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url ltx_font_typewriter">https://github.com/WeCanShow/MCL</a>.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Along with the prosperity of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) play a more and more important role in the design of
safety-critical systems (e.g., autonomous driving <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">autonomous_driving </a></cite>, medical diagnosis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">WangPLLBS17 </a></cite> and plant control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">ShiXXQ22 </a></cite>) for the purposes of intelligent sensing and control. However, due to
the steadily increasing popularity, DNNs are inevitably
becoming the focus of various malicious adversaries <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">song2020fda </a></cite>.
For example, due to biased third-party
training data or
improper training processes, a tiny adversarial
input perturbation during the test phase can fool a target
DNN to make misclassification <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">Carlini017 </a></cite>, resulting in
disastrous consequences. Recently,
backdoor attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">badnets </a></cite> have emerged as a notable
security threat to DNNs.
By poisoning partial
training data, adversaries
can embed
backdoors
in some DNN by tricking it
to establish the correlations between trigger patterns and
target labels. In this way,
if some trigger pattern appears at test time, the DNN will make a preset prediction on purpose.
In response to the
situation of increasing popularity of backdoor attacks, various backdoor defense methods have been developed,
which can be mainly classified into two categories.
The first one is the
detection-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">zheng2021topological </a>; <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">hayase2020spectre </a>; <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">NC </a></cite>,
which can effectively
figure out whether training data are poisoned
or training processes are manipulated.
However, these methods focus
on the detection rather than elimination
of triggers within poisoned data or backdoors within DNNs.
In this paper, we focus on the second one, i.e.,
erasing-based methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2021neural </a>; <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2021anti </a>; <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">qiao2019defending </a></cite>
whose goal is to eliminate the
backdoor triggers by purifying the
malicious effects of backdoored DNNs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although existing
erasing-based methods are promising in
fixing backdoored DNNs, most of them face with the dilemma that
the reduction of Attack Success Rate (ASR) for DNNs
may notably sacrifice their
Benign Accuracy (BA) on clean data.
The reason of such low BA is mainly due to the
side effect of purification processes,
which messes up the feature space of backdoored DNNs.
According to the observation in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBD </a></cite>,
due to excessive learning capability of the end-to-end
supervised learning paradigm,
the features of backdoor triggers can be learned. As a result,
poisoned data prefer to form a new cluster
in the feature space of a backdoored DNN
rather than to locate
in the ones of
benign samples.
However, when conducting some kind of
purification on the backdoored DNN, the boundaries
of benign data clusters become blur, resulting in
the low BA.
Although
the decoupling-based backdoor defense approach introduced in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBD </a></cite> is the first to study
backdoors from the perspective of
hidden feature space, it focuses on the construction of DNNs that are
immune to backdoor attacks rather than eliminating backdoors from DNNs.
When more and more AI applications adopt pre-trained DNNs from untrusted third
parties, <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">how to
fully take the advantage of feature
distribution characteristics to
enhance the capability of erasing
backdoor triggers without degrading BA
is becoming a challenging direction in backdoor defense.
</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Contrastive learning methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">simclr </a>; <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2020big </a>; <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">he2020momentum </a>; <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2021exploring </a></cite> have been acknowledged as a promising way to learn better
data feature representations.
By learning from both positive pairs constructed from different transformations of
same samples and negative pairs generated from different samples,
contrastive learning can make the features within a positive pair close to each other,
and make
the two features within a negative pair far away from each other.
Therefore,
contrastive learning is the best fit for backdoor elimination from the perspective of feature distributions,
since it can shrink the cluster of poisoned data as much as possible while
making the feature representations close to
their benign counterparts.
Based on this understanding,
in this paper we propose a novel Model-Contrastive Learning (MCL)-based
backdoor defense method, named MCLDef, which can make full use of the
distribution characteristics of both poisoned and benign samples
in the feature space for the purpose of
purifying backdoored DNNs.

Generally, a backdoor attack refers to embedding
a backdoor
into
some DNN by poisoning part of its
training data, where triggers can be controlled by
adversaries to manipulate DNN outputs, causing incorrect or unexpected behaviors.
As the most common backdoor attack paradigm,
poisoned-label attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">badnets </a>; <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">trojann </a></cite>
stamp backdoor triggers onto
benign training
data and replace
their labels with attacker-specified ones.
For example, Chen et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">physics_backdoor </a></cite> introduced
the <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">blended attack</span> that
generates poisoned instances and backdoor instances
by blending benign input data with a specific key pattern.
In practice, to avoid the early detection of backdoor attacks
from observable training data, most attackers prefer to adopt
backdoor attacks with imperceptible changes, e.g.,
natural reflection <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2020reflection </a></cite> and human imperceptible noise <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhong2020backdoor </a></cite>.
As an alternative, clean-label attacks only modify partial training data
without tempering their labels.
For example, Turner et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">CL </a></cite> proposed the <span id="S2.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">clean-label attack</span>
that adopts
adversarial perturbations or generative models to tamper with
benign data from the target class and then performs trigger injection, thus
establishing the connection between triggers and their target labels.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">Sig </a></cite>, Barni et al.
implemented a clean-label attack using sinusoidal bands as the trigger.
Note that, although
clean-label attacks are more stealthy than
poisoned-label attacks, they greatly suffers from the problems of low
ASR or even failures in creating backdoors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2020backdoor </a></cite>.</p>

<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Backdoor Defense.</span>
The mainstream
backdoor defense methods can be mainly classified into
two categories, i.e., the detection-based methods and
the erasing-based methods.
The former one can be used to: i) identify
backdoors of DNNs during the training <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">zheng2021topological </a>; <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">dong2021black </a>; <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">xiang2022post </a></cite>;
or ii) check whether the data are poisoned <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">hayase2020spectre </a>; <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">zeng2021rethinking </a>; <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">tang2021demon </a></cite>, thus
the poisoning data can be safely filtered during the training.
The latter category
consists of three directions:
i) <span id="S2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">model reconstruction-based defense</span> that leverages
DNN finetuing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2021neural </a>; <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">liu2018fine </a>; <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">zeng2021adversarial </a></cite> using
a limited set of clean data
to eradicate
backdoor triggers;
ii) <span id="S2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">poison suppression-based defense</span> that mitigates
the impacts of poisoned
samples during the training process <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2021anti </a>; <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBD </a>; <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">borgnia2021strong </a></cite>;
and iii) <span id="S2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">trigger synthesis-based defense</span> that
uses trigger synthesis to construct poisoned samples
for the purpose of backdoor trigger elimination <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">NC </a>; <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">qiao2019defending </a></cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Contrastive Learning.</span> Contrastive learning has been widely investigated
in self-supervised learning to achieve
desired feature representations from unlabeled samples
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">simclr </a>; <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2020big </a>; <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">he2020momentum </a>; <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen2021exploring </a>; <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">jing2020self </a></cite>.
Its basic idea is to
reduce the distance of
feature representations of two samples within a positive pair
as much as possible, and
enlarge the distance of feature representations of different samples
within negative pairs.
Besides the contrastive learning on samples, Model-Contrastive Learning (MCL)
has been studied
to correct the bias of local models for federated learning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">moon </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">

construct DNNs that are immune to backdoor attacks by decoupling training processes. However, this method cannot be directly used to purify
backdoored DNNs. To the best of our knowledge, MCLDef is the first attempt that leverages the merits of MCL to eliminate backdoors in DNNs. By correcting the feature representations of poisoned samples, MCLDef
can not only mitigate the malicious impacts of backdoor attacks, but also
maintain an expected classification performance with high BA.</p>

Similar to other classical backdoor defense methods, in this paper we assume that
a backdoored DNN is trained by an unreliable third-party dataset,
where attackers can arbitrarily modify the training dataset but cannot control the
training process. Meanwhile,
we assume that partial (e.g., 5%)
clean training data is available to finetune the backdoored model.
The goal of MCLDef is to use such
clean data to purify the poisoned DNN by erasing the
injected backdoor without degrading the classification performance on benign data.</p>

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To understand the distribution characteristics of feature representations in the hidden feature space,
we evaluate the effects of five backdoor injection attacks, i.e.,
BadNets <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">badnets </a></cite>, Trojan <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">trojann </a></cite>, Blend <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">physics_backdoor </a></cite>, CL <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">CL </a></cite>, and Sig <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">Sig </a></cite>, respectively, on Cifar-10 dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">krizhevsky2009learning </a></cite>.
Here, we obtain feature vectors of the test result from the feature extractor (the DNN without the last
classifier layer) and use t-SNE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">van2008visualizing </a></cite> for visualization. Please refer to
Appendix <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A Implementation Details for Section 3.1 ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a> for more details about the experimental settings.
Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows the distributions of feature representations of both
benign and poisoned samples under the five attacks respectively. For different kinds of
input training
samples, we marked
their feature representations in different colors (i.e., color 0 to 9). Note that in each subfigure the feature representations of
poisoned data are marked
in black color.
From this figure, we can clearly find that the feature representations of
benign samples from the same category of Cifar-10 form an individual cluster, while all the poisoned samples form a new cluster (in black color) in the feature space. According to the observation in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">DBD </a></cite>, this new cluster implicitly
reflects the features of the injected trigger itself.
Note that the attacks
in Figure <a href="#S2.F1.sf1" title="(a) ‣ Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(a)</span></a>, <a href="#S2.F1.sf2" title="(b) ‣ Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(b)</span></a> and <a href="#S2.F1.sf3" title="(c) ‣ Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(c)</span></a>
are all poisoned-label backdoor attacks. From these three subfigures, we
can observe that the black cluster can be
further divided into 10 subclusters, which correspond to the 10 clusters of their benign counterparts.
This phenomenon again demonstrates that the sample feature is also learnt by the DNN.
Unlike the three attacks, the ones used
in Figure <a href="#S2.F1.sf4" title="(d) ‣ Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(d)</span></a> and <a href="#S2.F1.sf5" title="(e) ‣ Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1(e)</span></a> are all clean-label attacks,
where we can only find one single dense
black cluster for the poisoned samples. This is because
clean-label methods only attack the samples with
a specific target-label (i.e., the label that corresponds to blue color in this example).</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Based on the above observations, we can find that the cluster of poisoned samples
indicates the trigger pattern for backdoor attack from the perspective of feature space.
In other words, if we can shrink or damage such a
cluster of poisoned samples, we can eliminate the backdoor triggers as well.
However, this may cause the problem of low BA, since the new features of poisoned
samples will be scattered improperly to the incorrect places of the feature space.
To avoid BA degradation, it is required that the new features of poisoned samples after purification
can located close to their benign counterparts.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we resort to MCL for the backdoor defense, which
naturally matches the observations in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Motivation from Hidden Feature Space ‣ 3 Our MCL-based Backdoor Defense Method ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>. The basic idea of our approach is to
define a benign sample and its poisoned counterpart as a positive pair and define
two different benign samples as a negative pair. Under the guidance of
MCL, the cluster of poisoned samples will be damaged, and the new features
of poisoned samples will be pulled towards to the ones of their benign counterparts.
In this way, the backdoor triggers will be eliminated with negligible BA loss.</p>

<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To enable MCL for backdoor defense, we need to figure out two questions first.
The first one is “how can we figure out the clusters for poisoned samples”, and the second one is
“how can we accommodate the MCL to enable efficient backdoor defense without
degrading BA”. To address these two questions, in this paper we propose a novel two-stage MCL-based
backdoor defense method called MCLDef as shown in Figure <a href="#S3.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 3.2 Overview of Our Approach ‣ 3 Our MCL-based Backdoor Defense Method ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>. The first stage
performs trigger inversion based on an existing
trigger synthesis method presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">NC </a></cite> that converts the
trigger inversion into an optimization problem. Based on the poisoned samples generated
by the obtained inverted trigger in the first stage, the second stage utilizes the model-based
constrastive learning to purify the backdoored DNNs based on our defined
positive and negative pairs.
Note that in our approach, we treat a DNN as
a combination of two disjoint parts including a feature extractor and a classifier (i.e, fully connected
layers), whereas the positive and negative pairs are constructed based on the outputs of
feature extractors of both the poisoned model and purified model.
Based on the calculated contrastive loss, the backdoor elimination process iterates until
the convergence of purification. The following subsections will detail the key components and
steps of our approach.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">3.3 </span>Trigger Inversion (Stage 1)</h3>

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As aforementioned, our approach
purifies backdoored DNNs based on both the positive and negative pairs of feature representations.
Since our approach only uses a small set of clean samples for the purpose of finetuning,
we need to figure out
their poisoned counterparts. However, for a given backdoored DNN, it is hard to know which kind of
backdoor attack is applied on the model. To address this problem,
the first stage of our approach resorts to trigger inversion, which can effectively to figure out a trigger to derive
poisoned
samples with high quality.
Here, we adopt the same trigger inversion implementation as the
well-known Neural Cleanse (NC) method <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">NC </a></cite>.

<div id="S3.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The positive pairs and negative pairs play an important role in
MCL to determine the correlations between
feature representations in feature space. By definition, after the contrastive learning, the two
elements of a positive pair will become closer to each other , while the distance of
two elements within a negative pair will become longer.
Based on these facts, to accommodate MCL
to the backdoor defense, we define the positive pairs by coupling
the feature representation of a benign sample in the poisoned model and
the feature representation of its poisoned counterpart
from the purified model together.
Since the poisoned model behaves normally on benign samples, in this way
wen can pull the feature representations of poisoned samples toward those of their clean sample counterparts in the feature space of purified model, thus the BA can be guaranteed.
Meanwhile, since we want to shrink or even totally damage the cluster of poisoned samples in the
purified model, we define a negative pair by coupling the
feature representations of a poisoned
sample in both the poisoned model and purified model together.
In this way, the purification can
scatter the clustered
feature representations of
poisoned samples within feature space of the purified model, thus damaging the
trigger pattern of the purified model.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">As aforementioned, we can get the trigger pattern and the mask, which can be used to generate the poisoned data. According to the definition of positive and negative pairs in Section <a href="#S3.SS4" title="3.4 Construction of Positive and Negative Pairs ‣ 3 Our MCL-based Backdoor Defense Method ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.4</span></a>, we can get the positive pairs and negative pairs. However, the final goal is to eliminate the backdoor trigger and reduce the loss of the BA. Therefore, we need to accommodate the MCL to enable efficient backdoor defense without degrading BA. The second stage of our approach resorts to MCL, which can reduce the distance of feature representations of a positive pair as much as possible, while enlarging the distance of feature representations of a negative pair.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To show the effectiveness of our approach,
we implemented MCLDef using Pytorch, and
compared the performance of MCLDef with
four start-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor elimination methods.
All the experimental results were obtained from a
a workstation with 3.6GHz Intel i9 CPU, 32GB memory, NVIDIA GeForce RTX3090 GPU, and Ubuntu operating system.
We designed comprehensive experiments to answer the following three research questions:</p>

We compared MCLDef with four SOTA backdoor defense methods, i.e., Fine-Tuning (FT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">trojann </a></cite>, Neural Attention Distillation (NAD) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2021neural </a></cite>, Implicit Backdoor Adversarial Unlearning (I-BAU) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">zeng2021adversarial </a></cite>, and
Neural Cleanse (NC) with unlearning strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">NC </a></cite>. Similar to the work in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">li2021neural </a></cite>, we assumed that all
the methods could access 5% clean training data for the finetuning.
For MCLDef, we adopted the same settings as the ones used by
NC <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">NC </a></cite> for the implementation of trigger inversion.
Note that the initial purified model and poisoned model in model-contrastive
backdoor elimination are the same. For the purified model, we set its

evaluate the performance of all the defense methods: i)
Attack Success Rate (ASR) indicating the
ratio of succeed attacks over all the attacks on
clean test samples without target labels; and ii)
Benign Accuracy (BA) denoting the ratio of correctly

to indicate the method with no defense.
Note that to enhance the defense performance, here we adopt the data augmentation techniques for backdoor trigger elimination for all the
defense methods. Please refer to Appendix <a href="#A3.SS1" title="C.1 Impact of Data Augmentation Techniques ‣ Appendix C Supplementary Experimental Results ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">C.1</span></a> for more results

<p id="S4.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">From this table, we can find that for the dataset Cifar-10,
MCLDef achieves the best ASR among all the five defense methods.
and the best BA in four out of five attacks.
Specifically, compared with the second-best results marked with underscores,
MCLDef can reduce the ASR by 21.27%, 32.12%, 8.22%, 95.79%, and 47.72% for the
five defense methods, respectively.
For the Sig attack, the reason of low BA for MCLDef (i.e., 73.81%)
is mainly due to the bad
quality of trigger inversion, which is also reflected in the case of NC (i.e., 73.34%).
Note that the datasets GTSRB and ImageNet often cause the failures for
clean-label attacks, we do not provide their comparison results here.
We can observe that, for the datasets GTSRB and ImageNet,
MCLDef can achieve the best BA and top-2 best ASR for all the cases.
As an example for GTSRB with Blend attack, MCLDef outperforms NC by up to 70.37% in ASR,
and outperforms FT by 3.3% in BA.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Based on Cifar-10, Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Settings ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> visualizes the distributions in feature space
for the two representative attacks, where each backdoored DNN is purified by three
defense methods (i.e., NAD, NC and MCLDef).
Note that, unlike the Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> that only uses

all the six subfigures in Figure <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Settings ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> show the t-SNE using both

are all damaged by
the three defense methods, respectively. However,
in Figure <a href="#S4.F3.sf3" title="(c) ‣ Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Settings ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(c)</span></a> there are fewer
black features locating outside the clusters than the other two
subfigures, indicating that MCLDef can achieve
better BA after defending BadNets attacks.
Similarly, in <a href="#S4.F3.sf4" title="(d) ‣ Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Settings ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(d)</span></a>, <a href="#S4.F3.sf5" title="(e) ‣ Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Settings ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(e)</span></a> and <a href="#S4.F3.sf6" title="(f) ‣ Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Settings ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3(f)</span></a> the cluster of poisoned samples by CL is also
damaged. Since CL is a clean-label attack
that focuses on the attacking samples with a specific target label
(indicated by the blue color here), we can find that
the black features locate in the blue cluster in a
more concentrated manner, thus leading to a better BA.</p>

the defense performance trends of five defense methods (FT, NAD, I-BAU,

for more results of other four backdoor attacks.
From this figure, we can find that more clean data will lead to lower
ASR and higher BA for the purified DNNs of all the defense methods. Note that with
only 1% clean data, both NC and MCLDef can achieve significant ASR reduction, while
ASR improvements of the other three defense methods are negligible.
However, in this case both NC and MCLDef need to sacrifice their BA, since the
the quality of trigger inversion is poor due to a limited number of clean data.

we can find that ASRs of the five
attacks will not change notably, and MCLDef can achieve the best ASR and BA.
When the clean data rate reaches 20%, although
MCLDef has the best ASR, its BA drops. Note that in this case the BA of
FT, NAD, and NC becomes
higher than the BA (i.e., 83.01%) of the method without defense.
The main reason of the decreasing trend of BA is because
MCLDef is based on MCL, where the distance between two features
within a negative becomes farther along the backdoor purification process.
When more and more clean data are involved in
backdoor trigger elimination,
such mutual exclusion between features imposed by
negative pairs will more easily result in the shape change of
benign clusters, leading to lower BA.
To verify the reason of this phenomenon,
we developed a new method MCLDef+ with
one more
stage than MCLDef, where the third stage only
uses the positive pairs to eliminate the backdoor from
the purified model generated by stage two.
The goal of the third stage is to increase
BA by further
pulling the features in
positive pairs closer to their corresponding benign clusters.

From Figure <a href="#S4.F4.sf2" title="(b) ‣ Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Applicability Analysis (RQ3) ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4(b)</span></a>, we can find
that when more clean data are provided,
MCLDef+ can achieve better BA than MCLDef.
Note that if the size of available clean data is small (i.e., clean sample rate is less than 10%),
we suggest to use MCLDef. Otherwise, MCLDef+ is a better choice for backdoor defense.</p>

Since MESA makes a stronger assumption that
both the size and location of a trigger is known a prior, its
trigger inversion quality if better than ours.
Note that due to limitations specific in MESA, we only
implemented the MESA-based defense against three attacks excluding Blend and Sig attacks.
Moreover, instead of using trigger inversion, we developed a method named
<span id="S4.SS4.p2.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">MCLDef(True)</span>, where the first stage is replaced with a hard-coded real trigger
with the highest trigger inversion capability among all the methods.

From this table, we can find that the higher quality the trigger inversion method has, the better ASR and BA the corresponding defense can achieve.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Inspired by the observation that in the feature space of a backdoored DNN
the feature representations of both benign samples with
the same category and the poisoned samples are separately clustered,
we proposed a novel two-stage model-contrastive learning framework
named MCLDef for the purpose of backdoor defense.
Based on our proposed definitions of
positive and negative pairs of features,
MCLDef can shrink or even damage the cluster of poisoned samples
and pull the poisoned samples towards the clusters of their benign counterparts. In this way, the backdoor triggers in DNNs are eliminated and
the classification accuracy on benign samples can be guaranteed.
Comprehensive experimental results shows that, compared with various kinds of
state-of-the-art defense methods,
our approach can not only achieve significantly lower ASR but also have a better benign accuracy under the help of only 5% clean data.</p>

To observe the distribution characteristics of both benign and poisoned samples in feature space, we used different colors in t-SNE visualization for benign samples with a specific category and poisoned samples, respectively.
Here, we use the feature vectors obtained from the
feature extractor (a DNN without the last layer of classifiers) as the inputs of t-SNE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite> for visualization.
To enable better visualization effect,
all the t-SNE figures in this paper show all the
investigated poisoned samples and partial (i.e., 20%) clean samples
that are randomly selected from each category of a dataset.</p>

Note that
to enhance the defense quality, we used data augmentation techniques (including random crop and random horizontal flipping) for finetuing.
For NAD, when dealing with datasets Cifar-10 and GTSRB, we use the same setting as described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
When dealing with the ImageNet subset,
we calculated the NAD loss only based on

using data augmentation techniques
for the five defense methods by using Cifar-10 dataset.
From this table, we can find that our MCLDef can achieve the best performance in ASR, and the best BA in three out of five attacks.
The difference between the defense performance of MCLDef in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Settings ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> and Table <a href="#A3.T4" title="Table 4 ‣ C.1 Impact of Data Augmentation Techniques ‣ Appendix C Supplementary Experimental Results ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> is negligible.
Note that, we can find that FT and NAD methods greatly rely on
the use of data augmentation techniques. Compared with the results in

To enhance the attack performance,
data augmentation techniques are widely used in
the training of poisoned models.
To evaluate the performance of MCLDef for this case, we
use the data augmentation techniques (i.e., random crop and random horizontal flipping) to derive training samples for poisoned models.
To accommodate such extra training samples, in CL attack we changed the position of triggers accordingly, i.e., we placed the trigger in the center of images. To obtain the poisoned models for the five
attacks, we trained each backdoored DNN for 100 epochs with an
initial learning rate of 0.1, which is reduced by a factor of 10 at the <math id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="20^{th}" display="inline"><semantics id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1a"><msup id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mn id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">20</mn><mrow id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mo id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml">⁢</mo><mi id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml">h</mi></mrow></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.2">20</cn><apply id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3"><times id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.2">𝑡</ci><ci id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1.1.3.3">ℎ</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1c">20^{th}</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="A3.SS1.p3.1.m1.1d">20 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_t italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT</annotation></semantics></math> and <math id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="70^{th}" display="inline"><semantics id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1a"><msup id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mn id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">70</mn><mrow id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><mi id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml">t</mi><mo id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.1" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml">⁢</mo><mi id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.3" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml">h</mi></mrow></msup><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1b"><apply id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1">superscript</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.2">70</cn><apply id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3"><times id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.1"></times><ci id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.2">𝑡</ci><ci id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.3.cmml" xref="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1.1.3.3">ℎ</ci></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1c">70^{th}</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="A3.SS1.p3.2.m2.1d">70 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_t italic_h end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT</annotation></semantics></math> epochs, respectively.

From this table, we can find that MCLDef can achieve the best ASR and BA for all the poisoned-label attacks. However, although MCLDef outperforms NC for Sig in terms of both ASR and BA, its defense is not
as good as the ones of the other three defense methods (i.e., FT, NAD, I-BAU). Based on the observations in
Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Comparison with SOTA Defense Methods (RQ1) ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the reason
for the low performance here is mainly due to the
quality of trigger inversion. If a new trigger inversion method
with higher
quality can be integrated into the first stage, the defense performance of
MCLDef will be greatly improved for the Sig attack.</p>

The main reason for this trend is because the distance between two features within a negative becomes farther along the backdoor purification process. When more and more clean data are involved in backdoor trigger elimination, such mutual exclusion between features imposed by negative pairs will more easily result in the shape change of benign clusters. Therefore, we add an extra stage to verify the phenomenon, named <span id="A3.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">positive pair correction</span>.

compares
the defense performance of five defense methods against Trojan, Blend, CL and Sig attacks using
different clean data sizes. From this figure, we can draw
the same
conclusion as the one made in
Section <a href="#S4.SS4" title="4.4 Applicability Analysis (RQ3) ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Model-Contrastive Learning for Backdoor Defense" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.4</span></a>.
We can find that more clean data will lead to better ASR, and MCLDef and MCLDef+ can always have the best ASR.
Moreover, MCLDef+ can indeed improves the BA of MCLDef.</p>
