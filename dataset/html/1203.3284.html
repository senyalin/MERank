<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">We study a character-based phylogeny reconstruction problem when
an incomplete set of data is given.
More specifically, we consider the situation under the
directed perfect phylogeny
assumption with binary characters in which for some species the
states of some characters are missing.
Our main object is to give an efficient algorithm to enumerate (or list)
all perfect phylogenies that can be obtained when the missing entries are
completed.
While a simple branch-and-bound algorithm (B&amp;B) shows a theoretically
good performance, we propose another approach based on a zero-suppressed binary
decision diagram (ZDD).
Experimental results on randomly generated data exhibit that
the ZDD approach outperforms B&amp;B.
We also prove that counting the number of phylogenetic trees consistent with
a given data is #P-complete, thus providing an evidence that an efficient
random sampling seems hard.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the most important problems in phylogenetics is reconstruction of
phylogenetic trees.
In this paper, we focus on the character-based approach.
Namely, each species is described by their characters, and a mutation corresponds to
a change of characters.
However, in the real-world data not all states of all characters are observable or
reliable, which makes the data incomplete.
Thus, we need a methodology that can cope with such incompleteness.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.6" class="ltx_p">Following Pe’er et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>,
we work with the <em id="S1.p2.6.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">perfect phylogeny</em> assumption, which means that the set of all nodes
with the same character state induces a connected subtree.
All characters are <em id="S1.p2.6.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">binary</em>, namely take only two values.
Without loss of generality, assume that these two values are encoded by <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mn id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1">0</cn></annotation-xml></semantics></math> and <math id="S1.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">1</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1b"><cn type="integer" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.2.m2.1.1">1</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1c">1</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S1.p2.2.m2.1d">1</annotation></semantics></math>.
Then, the phylogeny is <em id="S1.p2.6.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">directed</em> in a sense that

(this is also called the Camin–Sokal parsimony <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>).
We consider the situation where for some species the states of some
characters are unknown.
Under this setting,
Pe’er et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>
provided a polynomial-time algorithm to reconstruct a
phylogenetic tree that can be obtained when the unknown states are
completed, if it exists.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although their algorithm can find a phylogenetic tree efficiently, it does not
take the likelihood into account.
This motivates people to look at optimization problems; namely we may introduce an objective
function (or an evaluation function) and try to find a perfect phylogeny that
maximizes the value of the function.
For example, Gusfield et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> looked at such an
optimization problem and formulated it as an integer linear program.
One big issue here is that these optimization problems tend to be NP-hard, and thus
we cannot expect to obtain polynomial-time algorithms.
Therefore, we need some compromise.
If we insist on efficiency, then we need to sacrifice the quality of an obtained
solution.
This approach leads us to approximation algorithms.
If we insist on optimality, then we need to sacrifice the running time.
This approach leads us to exponential-time exact algorithms.
However, techniques in the literature as Gusfield et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> with these approaches use specific
structures of the form of objective functions.</p>

<section id="S1.SS1" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">1.1 </span>Our Results</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The focus of this paper is the exact approach.
However, unlike the previous work,
we aim at <em id="S1.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">enumeration algorithms</em>, which give a more flexible framework
for scientific discovery independent of the form of objective functions.
The use of enumeration algorithms is highlighted in data mining and artificial
intelligence.
For example, the apriori algorithm by Agrawal and Srikant
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> enumerates all maximal frequent
itemsets in a transaction database.
It is not expected that such enumeration algorithms run faster than non-enumeration
algorithms.
Therefore, the goal of this paper is to examine
a possibility and a limitation of enumerative approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One of the difficulties in designing efficient enumeration algorithms is to avoid
duplication.
Suppose that we are to output an object, and need to check if this object was already
output or not.
If we store all objects that we output so far, then we can check it by going through
them.
However, storing them may take too much space, and going through them may take too much time.
The number of obejcts is typically exponentially large.
Our algorithm cleverly avoids such checks, but still ensures
exhaustive enumeration without duplication.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It is rather straightforward to give an algorithm with theoretical
guarantee such as polynomiality.
Namely, a simple branch-and-bound idea gives an algorithm that
has a running time polynomial in the input size and
linear in the output size.
Notice that an enumeration algorithm outputs all the objects, and thus
the running time needs to be at least as high as the number of output objects.
Thus, the linearity in the output size cannot be avoided
in any enumeration algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">However, such a theoretically-guaranteed algorithm does not necessarily
run fast in practice.
Thus, we propose another algorithm that is based on
a zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZDD).
A ZDD was introduced by Minato <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
It is a directed graph that has a
similar structure to a binary decision diagram (BDD).
While a BDD is used to represent a boolean function
in a compressed way, a ZDD only represents
the satisfying assignments of the function in a compressed way
(a formal definition will be given in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 ZDD Approach ‣ Efficient Enumeration of the Directed Binary Perfect Phylogenies from Incomplete DataPartially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, Japan, and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and by Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO) from Japan Science and Technology Agency. The extended abstract version of this paper appears in 11th International Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA 2012) [9]." class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>).
Furthermore, we may employ a lot of operations on ZDDs, called the family algebra,
which can be used for efficient filtering and optimization with respect to
some objective functions.
A book of Knuth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> devotes one section to ZDDs, and gives
numerous applications as exercises.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although the size of a constructed ZDD is bounded by a polynomial of the number of
output objects,
we cannot guarantee that the size of a ZDD that is
created at the intermediate steps in the course
of our algorithm is bounded.
This means that we cannot guarantee a polynomial-time running time
(in the input size and the output size) for our ZDD algorithm.
However, the crux here is that the size of a constructed ZDD can be
much smaller than the number of output objects.
We exhibit this phenomenon in two ways.
First, we give an example in which the number of phylogenetic trees
is exponential in the input size, but the size of the constructed
ZDD is polynomial in the input size.
Second, we perform experiments on randomly generated data, and the result
shows that our ZDD algorithm can solve more instances than a
branch-and-bound algorithm.
This suggests that the ZDD approach is quite promising.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Having enumeration algorithms, we can also count the number of
phylogenetic trees.
In particular, the branch-and-bound algorithm can count them in polynomial time
in the input size and the output size.
This naturally raises the following question:
Is it possible to count them in polynomial time only in the input size?
Note that since we only compute the number, we do not have to output each
object one by one, and thus the linearity of the running time in the output
size could be avoided.
Such a polynomial-time counting algorithm could be combined with
a branch-and-bound enumeration algorithm to design a random sampling algorithm.
Namely, when we branch, we count the number of outputs in each subinstance
in polynomial time, and choose one subinstance at random according to the
computed numbers.
For more on the connection of counting and sampling,
we refer to a book by Sinclair <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">We prove that this is unlikely.
Namely, counting the number of phylogenetic trees for the incomplete directed
binary perfect phylogeny is #P-complete.
The complexity class #P contains all counting problems in which a counted object
has a polynomial-time verifiable certificate.
Since no #P-complete problem is known to be solved in polynomial time,
the #P-completeness suggests the unlikeliness for the problem to be solved in
polynomial time.</p>

Golumbic et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> proved that
even for some
restricted classes of graphs, the problem is NP-complete.
The subsequent results by various researchers also show that
for a lot of cases the problem is NP-complete, even though the recognition problem
for those classes can be solved in polynomial time
(we will not include here a long list of literature).
Thus, the result by Pe’er et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>
gives a rare example for which the graph sandwich problem can be solved
in polynomial time.</p>

“efficient” means that it runs in polynomial time in the input size and linear
time in the output size.
Their approach was generalized by Heggernes et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>
to all sandwich-monotone graph classes.
In this respect, this paper gives another example of
efficient graph sandwich enumeration algorithms.</p>

Step 1 uses the deterministic version of Algorithm A in the paper by Pe’er et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, p. 598]</cite>, but we have simplified it to gain a
practical performance.
For example, a set is represented by an integer in such a way that each element of the set
corresponds to a bit in the integer.

This enables us to perform each set-theoretic operation
efficiently by one or two bit operations.
Further, we only count the number of directed binary perfect phylogenies, not
outputting all of them, to avoid an inessential computation in time measurement.</p>

Furthermore, the variables meeting the condition 1 have been put at the tail of

This also affects Step 3: some variables can be further removed, or further
put at the tail of the linear order.
We have tried to find a complete linear order
so that the size of the constructed ZDD could be small.
To this end, we have introduced two heuristic methods.
The first one has put the variables in the same <math id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="S_{i}" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1a"><msub id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1" xref="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml">S</mi><mi id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml">i</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1b"><apply id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.2">𝑆</ci><ci id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1.1.3">𝑖</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1c">S_{i}</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S5.SS2.p2.8.m8.1d">italic_S start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT</annotation></semantics></math> as closely as possible.
Since these variables possess heavier dependency, if we would
put them far, then the ZDD would need to store such dependency at various
locations.

This shows some gap between theory and practice, and it is desirable to have
some theoretical justification why <math id="S6.p1.7.m7.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathsf{ZDD}" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.7.m7.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.7.m7.1.1" xref="S6.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml">𝖹𝖣𝖣</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.7.m7.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.7.m7.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.7.m7.1.1">𝖹𝖣𝖣</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.7.m7.1c">\mathsf{ZDD}</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S6.p1.7.m7.1d">sansserif_ZDD</annotation></semantics></math> can outperform.
We have theoretically exhibited an example for which the compression by a ZDD is effective.
However, that example was artificial.
The experiments also show ZDD can compress very well on random instances.
It is desirable to obtain a more natural theoretical evidence why such a good compression is
achieved.</p>

<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The approach by ZDDs looks quite promising, and there must be more problems
